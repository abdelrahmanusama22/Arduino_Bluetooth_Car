## Overview

This project uses an Arduino to control a car via a Bluetooth module. The direction of the car is controlled by sending specific commands through a Bluetooth serial interface.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Motor driver module (e.g., L298N)
- Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05 or HC-06)
- Four connection wires
- Car chassis with motors
- USB cable for programming and power supply

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
